As a dedicated Global Tech Recruiter with 10 years of specialized experience, I focus on identifying and placing elite technical talent across the most transformative technology stacks — from foundational systems to AI-driven innovation.

My recruitment expertise centers on deep-tech domains where engineering excellence meets strategic business impact. I specialize in sourcing top-tier professionals across the following areas:

- Large Language Models (LLMs): Multi-modal AI, AIGC, Text2Image, Text2Video, AI agents, RAG, Code Agents, Code Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning, AI trustworthiness, E2E Autonomous Driving and AIOPS. 

- AI Infrastructure: AI Chips, DL Frameworks, AI compiler toolchains, AI infra system performance — with a focus on LLM training optimization, model deployment (inference), sparsity, and model compression.  

- Core Systems & Infrastructure: OS kernels, compilers, MLIR, programming languages, virtual machines, IDEs.  

- Web & Data Innovation: Web engines, web security, database kernels,OLAP,OLTP, vector/graph databases, cloud data warehouses, embedded databases, and AI-Native data fusion (Data + AI). 

- Cloud & Cloud-Native Technologies: IaaS (cloud networking, storage, virtualization), PaaS (Kubernetes, Docker, containerization, cloud-native architecture, service mesh, serverless), and SaaS (cloud desktop, migration, delivery).  

- Applications & Frameworks: Cross-platform and UI frameworks, multimedia systems (audio/video, graphics/image processing), and industrial rendering solutions.

With a strong footprint across APAC, Europe, and North America, I work closely with innovation-driven startups, scale-ups, and Fortune 500 technology firms to build high-performance engineering teams.

What sets me apart is not just my deep technical understanding of these stacks — I’ve spent years working alongside architects, researchers, and engineers — but also my ability to identify the right talent at the right level, balancing technical depth, cultural fit, and long-term growth potential.

If you're a top-tier engineer, researcher, or architect in these domains — or a company building the next generation of technology — I’d love to connect.

Let’s build the future — together.
